# Recipes-
## Description 

‘Recipes!’ The app for all your recipes!! Ever need to make a meal with ingredients in your kitchen and don’t know what to make? *BOOM!* ‘Recipes!’ the app just for YOU!
- We wanted to come up with something that could help everyone. It just so happened to be helping everyone in the kitchen.
- We built this project because we figured it would be nice to do our take on the Recipe finder based on the ingredients in your house idea.
- The app solves the issue of finding out what recipes you can make in your house strictly off of what you currently already have in your house.
- We learned that database management and integration of relational databases were extremely challenging. We learned how to better manage foreign and primary keys linked between joined databases. We also learned how to properly interchange variables as well as image associations and presentation with recipes. We also learned how to better coordinate with github.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The first thing you'll want to do is log in or sign up if you don't have an account. After that you'll be taking to the Homepage where you'll be able to search up a recipe that you may have heard of that is in our database or you can scroll down and see some of the recipes that we do have up currently on our page with a beautiful description of the recipe. The concept then is that you'll be able to log in and submit your own recipe as well which would contribute to the health of the website as users could see what others around the world have to offer.
